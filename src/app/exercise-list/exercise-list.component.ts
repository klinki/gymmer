/**
 * Component for managing the exercise library and exercise selection.
 *
 * This component provides a comprehensive exercise management interface that allows users to:
 * - View all available exercises with execution count statistics
 * - Search and filter exercises by name (with diacritics support)
 * - Create new exercises
 * - Edit existing exercises
 * - Delete exercises
 * - Select exercises for training plans or current training sessions
 *
 * The component sorts exercises by execution count (most used first) and provides
 * real-time search functionality with normalized text matching.
