/**
 * Component for performing exercises during an active training session.
 *
 * This component is used when actively working out and allows users to:
 * - View the last execution of an exercise for reference
 * - Add new series (weight, repetitions, notes) to the current exercise
 * - Delete individual series from the current exercise
 * - Save the exercise execution and move to the next exercise
 *
 * The component automatically loads the last execution data to pre-populate
 * weight values for better user experience.
 *
 * @route /exercise/:id
 * @param id - Exercise ID from the route
